    Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way <br>
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.<br>
Santa clause, <br>Antartica
